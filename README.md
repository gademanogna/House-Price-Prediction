# House Price Prediction  

## Overview  
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. It analyzes various factors such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and other property attributes to build an accurate predictive model. The dataset undergoes preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables. Different regression models are trained and evaluated based on performance metrics to determine the most effective approach for price estimation.  

## Conclusion  
By leveraging machine learning, this project demonstrates how historical housing data can be used to predict future property values. The trained model provides valuable insights that can assist homebuyers, real estate agents, and investors in making informed decisions. The predictions help in understanding market trends and estimating property worth based on relevant features, making the pricing process more data-driven and reliable.
